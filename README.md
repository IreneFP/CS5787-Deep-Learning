# CS5787 Deep Learning

CS5787 Deep Learning - Prof. [Dr Christopher Kanan](https://chriskanan.com/) - Cornell Tech

This is a compilation of few different Deep Learning mini projects that I completed for the CS5787 course at Cornell Tech, NYC. Coded in Python.

Some solutions are not publicly available as requested by the professors. If interested in knowing more about these projects you can contact me at if76@cornell.edu.
